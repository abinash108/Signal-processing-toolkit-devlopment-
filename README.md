## Signal Processing Toolkit Development for SciLab - Internship Repository
Welcome to the Signal Processing Toolkit development repository for SciLab! This repository documents the progress and contributions made by Abinash Singh during the semester-long internship program, which commenced on March 24 and will conclude on May 24.

# About
This repository serves as a personal workspace for me to collaborate with mentors and peers, track project milestones, and showcase individual contributions to the development of the Signal Processing Toolkit for SciLab. Throughout the internship, I will be working on various tasks aimed at enhancing the functionality and usability of the toolkit.

# Project Overview
The goal of this internship project is to develop a comprehensive signal processing toolkit that seamlessly integrates with SciLab, an open-source numerical computational software package. The toolkit aims to provide a wide range of signal processing functionalities, including signal generation, filtering, Fourier analysis, spectral analysis, time-frequency analysis, and digital signal processing algorithms.
